# MIGRATION SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

## The Issue:
The migration files exist but the database tables haven't been created yet. You need to run the migrations to create the tables.

## Solution - Run these commands in order:

### 1. First, run migrations to create the database tables:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 2. If you get any migration conflicts, reset migrations (only if needed):
```bash
# Only run this if you get migration conflicts
python manage.py migrate --fake-initial
```

### 3. After migrations are successful, create the superuser:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 4. When creating superuser, use these details:
- **Email**: danish@gmail.com (must be valid email format)
- **Full name**: Danish Admin
- **Password**: (choose a strong password)

### 5. Then run the server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## If you still get migration errors:

### Option A: Reset migrations completely (if database is empty):
```bash
# Delete migration files (keep __init__.py)
# Then recreate them:
python manage.py makemigrations authentication
python manage.py makemigrations services
python manage.py migrate
```

### Option B: Check migration status:
```bash
python manage.py showmigrations
```

### Option C: Force migrate (if tables exist but Django doesn't know):
```bash
python manage.py migrate --fake
```

## Most likely you just need to run:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

The migration files are already correct and ready to use!
